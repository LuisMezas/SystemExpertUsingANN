# SystemExpertUsingANN
This project is intended for "Expert System", subject of Computer Systems Engineer at Instituto Tecnologico de Acapulco, Guerrero, MÃ©xico. 

We are using AForge.NET Framework, an Artificial Intelligence framework for .NET. The github link to this project is https://github.com/andrewkirillov/AForge.NET and the main page of the project http://www.aforgenet.com/framework. We'll be using this framework for the development of the Artificial Neural Network.

The problem this project is trying to solve is, evaluate info about applicants(students) that intend to earn a scholarship given by an institution (In Mexico, that institution usually is an government institution). 
The applicants information regularly is about: their monthly income, age, average grade, living place (such as their town, there are certain towns in Mexico that are marked as "susceptible to violence", said that, government usually tries to help students that live in that place, with a scholarship so they can continue their studies).
